<p class="quote">At 60 years of age [...] your site is giving me a lot of strenght and motivation to carry on and study new things. It reminds me of some of the idealism I  had as a younger person that compelled me to not let go on matters that I considered important but seem to have become unfashionable over time. Your site shows me that some of those values are still alive.

<p class="quote"> I discovered your site a year ago and it convinced me to switch to Linux - I haven't looked back.
